        <h3 id="how-to-increase-your-character-stats-in-gta-online"><strong>How to Increase Your Character Stats in GTA Online</strong></h3>
<p>Leveling up your character&rsquo;s skills will make you more effective in various aspects of the game, from combat to maneuverability. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how to improve each stat:</p>
<h4 id="-strength"><strong>üí™ Strength</strong></h4>
<p>The Strength stat affects your melee damage, durability (reducing damage from falls and accidents), and your ability to climb ladders faster and perform better in sports like tennis and golf.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Quickest Method (with a friend):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Have a friend get into a large, durable vehicle like a truck or an SUV.</li>
<li>Start punching and kicking the vehicle repeatedly.</li>
<li>Because you are not damaging another player, you won&rsquo;t get a wanted level.</li>
<li>This method can max out your strength stat in about 10-15 minutes of continuous punching.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solo Method:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Walk around the city and punch NPCs. This is slower as you will likely attract police attention.</li>
<li>Participate in melee-focused game modes like a simple Deathmatch with melee weapons.</li>
<li>Playing sports like Tennis or Golf will also gradually increase your strength. A full 9-hole round of golf gives a good boost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-driving"><strong>üöó Driving</strong></h4>
<p>The Driving stat improves your vehicle handling, especially when airborne, and allows for better control during wheelies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Races:</strong> The most straightforward way to increase your driving skill is to participate in races. You get a larger skill increase for completing overtakes and for finishing in the top positions.</li>
<li><strong>Stunt Jumps:</strong> Completing the 50 Stunt Jumps scattered across the map will significantly boost your driving stat. Each successful jump provides a noticeable increase.</li>
<li><strong>General Driving:</strong> Simply driving around, especially at high speeds and against the flow of traffic without crashing, will gradually increase this stat over time.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-stamina"><strong>üèÉ Stamina</strong></h4>
<p>Stamina determines how long you can sprint, cycle, and swim at full speed before your character gets tired.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Fastest Way:</strong> The quickest way to max out your stamina is by continuously sprinting. You can hold down the sprint button and your character will eventually run out of breath, but keep doing this and the stat will rise.</li>
<li><strong>Cycling:</strong> Riding a bicycle is also a very effective way to increase stamina and is generally faster than just sprinting on foot.</li>
<li><strong>Triathlons:</strong> Participating in triathlons is a great way to work on stamina as it involves swimming, cycling, and running.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-shooting"><strong>üî´ Shooting</strong></h4>
<p>A higher Shooting stat reduces recoil, increases accuracy, and allows you to carry more ammunition.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shooting Range:</strong> Visit any Ammu-Nation with a shooting range. Participating in the challenges here is a very effective and fast way to increase your shooting skill. Aim for headshots for the best results.</li>
<li><strong>Headshots in Missions:</strong> During any combat mission, consistently aiming for and landing headshots will rapidly increase your shooting stat.</li>
<li><strong>Survival Modes:</strong> Playing Survival modes will give you plenty of targets to shoot at, making it a practical way to improve your skill while also earning money and RP.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-stealth"><strong>ü§´ Stealth</strong></h4>
<p>The Stealth stat makes you quieter, allowing you to move around without being detected on enemy radars in both PvE and PvP situations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stealth Mode Walking:</strong> The most common method is to simply enter stealth mode (by pressing the left analog stick) and walk around. You can do this while doing other things in the game to passively level it up. A rubber band on your controller can allow you to do this while AFK.</li>
<li><strong>Stealth Takedowns:</strong> Performing stealth takedowns on enemies in missions will provide a significant boost to the stealth stat.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-flying"><strong>‚úàÔ∏è Flying</strong></h4>
<p>The Flying skill makes it easier to handle aircraft, reducing the effects of turbulence and improving takeoff and landing smoothness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flight School:</strong> The San Andreas Flight School, located at Los Santos International Airport, is by far the best way to increase your flying skill. Completing the lessons, especially with good medals, will max out this stat very quickly.</li>
<li><strong>General Flying:</strong> Simply spending time flying any aircraft, including helicopters and planes, will gradually increase this skill. Taking off and landing successfully contributes significantly.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-lung-capacity"><strong>ü§ø Lung Capacity</strong></h4>
<p>Lung Capacity determines how long you can stay underwater before you start to lose health.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Underwater Diving:</strong> The only way to increase this stat is by spending time underwater. Simply dive under the water and stay there until your health starts to flash, then surface for air and repeat.</li>
<li><strong>Scuba Gear:</strong> If you own a Scuba Suit (available at clothing stores) or use a vehicle like the Toreador or Stromberg, you can stay underwater indefinitely, but this will <em>not</em> increase your lung capacity. You need to be actively holding your breath for the stat to increase.</li>
</ul>
